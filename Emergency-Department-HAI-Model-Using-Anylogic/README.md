This repository hosts a simulation model developed using AnyLogic to study patient flow dynamics and the incidence of Healthcare-Associated Infections (HAIs) within an Emergency Department (ED) environment. HAIs, also known as nosocomial infections, present significant challenges in healthcare, leading to increased mortality, morbidity, and hospitalization durations. Our model utilizes patient flow data collected from University Health Truman Medical Center (UHTMC) spanning an 11-month period. By employing discrete-event simulation (DES) techniques, we examine how patient location and duration of stay correlate with HAI incidence rates in different ED areas such as triage, waiting rooms, and procedure rooms. The insights gained from this simulation can assist hospital administrators and infection control teams in implementing targeted strategies to reduce HAIs, enhance patient safety, and optimize resource allocation. This project underscores the value of simulation modeling in healthcare operations for improving patient outcomes and healthcare efficiency.
