SIRPS two-strain model 
We designed a two-strain deterministic model, referred to as the SIRPS model, to study the dynamics of the Salmonella pathogen in a dairy farm. The model divides the population into six distinct compartments:
Susceptible cow, denoted as S(t)
Cows infected with the drug-susceptible strain, I1(t)
Cows infected with the drug-resistant strain, I2(t)
Recovered cows, R(t)
Environment compartment containing the drug-susceptible pathogen, P1(t)
Environment compartment containing the drug-resistant pathogen, P2(t)
We performed 8 scenarios, such that in each scenario, some parameters change along with a degree of compliance to biosecurity measures divided into 4 levels: Excellent, Good, Marginal, and Low:
Scenario 1: Change in direct transmission rate (b1, b2)
Scenario 2: Change in indirect transmission rate (d1,d2)
Scenario 3: Change in pathogen removal rate (r)
Scenario 4: Change in antibiotic administration (eta) 
Scenario 5: Change change in direct transmission rate (b1,b2,d1,d2)
Scenario 6: Change in direct transmission rate coupled with a change in pathogen removal rate (b1,b2,r) 
Scenario 7: Change in indirect transmission rate combined with a change in  pathogen removal rate(d1,d2,r)
Scenario 8: Comprehensive change encompassing direct and indirect transmission rate, and pathogen removal rate (b1,b2,d1,d2,r)

For every scenario, we calculate the subsequent metrics:

Drug Susceptible Basic Reproduction Number (R01)
Drug-Resistant Basic Reproduction Number (R02)
Average prevalence for drug-susceptible strains
Maximum prevalence for drug-susceptible and drug-resistant strains
This comprehensive analysis aims to offer insights into how various intervention strategies influence the prevalence and transmission dynamics of drug-susceptible and drug-resistant pathogens
